# Changelog

All notable changes to molrs are recorded here. This project follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) conventions.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (breaking)

- **Force-field angles are now radians internally.** Angle `theta0`, dihedral/
  improper phase `d`/`phi`/`chi0` are stored and consumed in radians; kernel
  constructors no longer call `.to_radians()`, and each reader normalizes
  user-facing degree input at its boundary (LAMMPS `*.ff` deg→rad, MMFF94 XML
  deg→rad; the OPLS/GROMACS reader was already radians). Fixes a double-conversion
  that produced ~100+ kcal/mol of spurious angle energy on OPLS-typified
  structures at their reference angle.

### Release notes (single-crate merge)

- The merge of the former seven member crates into the single `molcrafts-molrs`
  crate is a **breaking** change and takes a coordinated minor/major version bump
  when released. The six former sub-crate crates.io names are **not** yanked, so
  molpack's `0.1.0` exact pin keeps resolving; the molpack migration to the merged
  crate is tracked as an out-of-tree follow-up. Do not publish/tag from the
  current working state.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **GROMACS TRR and XTC trajectory I/O.** Native readers and writers for the
  `.trr` (full-precision XDR; single/double; coordinates, velocities, forces)
  and `.xtc` (XDR + lossy `xdr3dfcoord` compression; classic 1995 and 2023
  magic) formats, alongside the existing DCD/GRO support. Each exposes
  sequential reads, single-frame access, and O(1) random access via
  `TrajReader::read_step` (lazy per-frame offset index), plus writers. The XTC
  compression codec is a clean-room implementation. Surfaced in Python as
  `molrs.read_trr`/`read_xtc`, the lazy `molrs.io.read_trr_trajectory`/
  `read_xtc_trajectory`, and `write_trr`/`write_xtc`.
- **compute ↔ fit separation.** Trajectory `Compute`s return raw curves/ACFs; a
  separate `Fit` family (`compute::fit`) performs the numerical fitting and
  spectral transforms as an explicit downstream step.

### Changed

- **Packaging: single published crate.** The former seven workspace crates
  (`core`/`io`/`signal`/`compute`/`ff`/`conformer` + façade) are merged into one
  `molcrafts-molrs` with feature-gated modules. The public Rust, Python, and
  WASM API surfaces are unchanged.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Force-field FFI handle.** `molrs_ffi::ForceFieldRef` — a stable, zero-copy
  handle for `molrs::ff::ForceField` (the force-field analogue of `FrameRef`),
  gated behind a new `ff` feature on `molcrafts-molrs-ffi`. Lets force-field
  consumers (e.g. molpack) borrow a `ForceField` across the FFI boundary.
- **`molrs::ff::potential::intramolecular_pairs`** — builds the intramolecular
  neighbour-pair `Block` for a frame, consumed by relaxation / energy callers.
- LAMMPS force-field reader and per-instance force-field parameter support.

### Changed

- `molrs::ff::potential` is now a directory module (`potential/`) rather than a
  single file; MMFF typifier internals reorganized. The WASM / TypeScript
  public surface (`@molcrafts/molrs` npm) is unchanged.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- `Frame.from_dict` on the native PyO3 core — accepts either the
  `{"blocks": {...}, "metadata": {...}}` envelope or a direct
  `{name: {column: array}}` mapping, completing the `to_dict` / `from_dict`
  round-trip. Column values use the same accepted types as `Block.insert`.
- `molrs.BlockDtypeError` — public exception (subclasses `TypeError`) raised by
  `Block.insert` on a non-numpy-representable column. Importable and stable so
  downstream code can `except molrs.BlockDtypeError` precisely.

### Changed

- **Block column dtype contract is now numpy-only, fail-fast (behavior change).**
  `Block.insert` (and therefore every `Frame` column write) now accepts only
  numpy-representable dtypes — float, int, bool, and str. Object-dtype,
  None-bearing, and ragged/mixed arrays were previously rejected with a generic
  `TypeError`; they now raise the new public `molrs.BlockDtypeError` with a
  message naming the offending column and the detected dtype. There is no
  Python-side object-column overflow — columns the Rust Store cannot represent
  must be coerced to a supported dtype or dropped by the caller.
