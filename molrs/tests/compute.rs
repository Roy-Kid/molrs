//! Integration tests for `molrs-compute`.
//!
//! The module tree below mirrors the crate's `src/` layout: one test module per
//! source area. Unlike `molrs-io`, compute does no file I/O — every test builds
//! its frames / point sets in code and asserts against the PUBLIC API. Inline
//! `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests inside `src/**` stay there; these integration tests
//! exercise cross-module guarantees (the `Graph` DAG) and end-to-end analyses
//! against known analytical results (RDF of a lattice, MSD of linear motion).
