//! Canonical molecular field-name convention — the single source of truth for
//! component (property) keys.
//!
//! ECS components are addressed by name. To keep field names from being
//! hard-coded as scattered string literals, **all** code references the
//! constants defined here rather than writing `"x"` / `"element"` inline. A
//! field is renamed in exactly one place. These names are kept in sync with
//! molpy's `core/fields.py` canonical field set so the two layers agree at the
//! boundary.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use molrs::store::keys;
//!
//! assert_eq!(keys::X, "x");
//! assert_eq!(keys::COORDS, [keys::X, keys::Y, keys::Z]);
//! ```
