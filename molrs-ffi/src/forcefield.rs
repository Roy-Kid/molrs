//! Stable handle for a molrs [`ForceField`] — the force-field analogue of
//! [`crate::FrameRef`].
//!
//! A force field is standalone: unlike a [`molrs::store::frame::Frame`] it does
//! not live in the slot-mapped [`crate::Store`], so this handle is a thin `Rc`
//! share rather than a `(handle, store)` pair. It exists so a force field can
//! cross a language / extension boundary the same way a frame does — the
//! producing binding (molrs-python) hands out a `PyCapsule` wrapping a clone of
//! this handle, and a consuming Rust binding (e.g. molpack) resolves the capsule
//! back to a `ForceFieldRef` and borrows the real core [`ForceField`] through
//! [`ForceFieldRef::with_forcefield`]. No marshalling, no parallel data type.
//!
//! Gated behind the `ff` feature because [`molrs::ff`] itself is.

/// attributes (e.g. `#[pyclass]`). The wrapped force field is immutable through
/// the handle — a relaxer / MD consumer only reads parameters to compile
/// potentials — so take an owned copy via [`ForceFieldRef::clone_forcefield`]
/// if mutation is ever needed.

/// Holds an `Rc`, so it is `!Send` like [`crate::FrameRef`]. The capsule that
/// carries it across a boundary is only ever created, read, and destroyed under
/// the Python GIL, which upholds the single-threaded discipline.
