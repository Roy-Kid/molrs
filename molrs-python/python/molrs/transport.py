"""Ion-transport trajectory-analysis kernels.

All computation is in Rust. The kernels are grouped under three thin namespace
classes (static methods over the compiled ``molrs.molrs`` PyO3 functions) so
callers reach them as ``molrs.transport.Onsager.correlation(...)`` rather than
through a flat list of free functions.

These are the molrs ports of the *tame* recipes
(<https://github.com/Roy-Kid/tame>): ``onsager`` (Onsager transport
coefficients), ``jacf`` (current-ACF Green–Kubo conductivity), and ``persist``
(pair-survival / residence-time correlations).
